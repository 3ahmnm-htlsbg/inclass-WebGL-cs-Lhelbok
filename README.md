# home-WebGL-movingBall-cs-Lhelbok

### Project description: 

This project is a github and C# exercise. The purpose of the exercise is to learn how to generate random numbers and use them in the script. Also, an important step in the process has been to build a WebGL solution and host it on GitHub pages.

The simple project consists of a screen independent canvas (960x600), a button (move ball), a text (title with name of developer and application), a script (move ball with button) and a GameObjects ball (2D graphic sprite imported).

When pressing the button "Move Ball" the ball moves randomly to one of the four predefined positions. There are 4 positions available (4 empty GameObjects: PosBottomLeft, PosBottomRight, PosTopLeft, PosTopRight). I solved this task with variant 1 (direct repetition of the randomly chosen position is possible).
